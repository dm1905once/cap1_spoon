## Spoon



#### Description

Imagine that you are honored (or burdened) with the privilege to prepare Thanksgiving dinner for all your extended family. You may have a rough idea of what the main dish is going to be, maybe think of a couple of appetizers and desserts. But the list keeps growing to the point on which just thinking of going to the supermarket to get all the ingredients may seem like a huge undertaking.  That's when this application may help.

**Spoon** lets you create *cooklists*. Think of them as 'playlists', but instead of adding songs to them, you add recipes.

In **Spoon** you can browse through thousands of recipes, pick your favorites and then organize them in cooklists. When ready to go to the supermarket you can just ask Spoon to generate a grocery list for you. You will get all the recipes' ingredients in one list.
